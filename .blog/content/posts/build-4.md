To start the day, Zach and I made a quick stop at OBI to pick up some lumber for the last frame pieces. We then spent the afternoon putting down some primer and the first coat of paint on the next three hexagon frames and corner praces. All together, a long, hot, 8-hour day - but solid progress made as the clock ticks down to Kiez Burn.
