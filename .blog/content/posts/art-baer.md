On June 1st-4th the initial version of Shifting Spectrums was intalled at a local event near Leipzig, [Art Baer](https://blog.artbaer.de/)

This version had just one of the hexagons, and no touch controller. We were using WLED to drive the LEDs and created a playlist of suble effects
that ran for 3 days creating a calming space to sit back and enjoy the lights.
