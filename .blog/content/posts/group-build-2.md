We spent a full day, racing against the rain and a block party happening in my Hinterhof a few hours later, cutting out pieces to assemble into the next 3 (4?) hexagons. In the end we ran out of time to finish the cutting. We managed to get about 75% of the cutting we wanted to finish done, but we still made massive progress.
