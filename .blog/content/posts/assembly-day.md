Another Saturday, another day of building in the Hinterhof...

We got off to a later start than anticipated, but still managed a solid 8 hours of build time before a thunderstorm rolled in. Sven stopped by in the early afternoon to help assemble the largest hexagon structure, bringing his tools and carpentry skills to knock out a major part of the build. This structure stands just shy of 2.2m tall. Curtsi arrived later in the evening, after making a stop at OBI to pick up the type of screws we needed to secure the metal inlays in each hexagon. Amber and Stefan passed by for a visit, supplying hugs and some much needed gin and tonic :) 

We managed to assemble all three hexagons and added some temporary feet for stability to test out the arrangement of the installation. Just as we were about to finish wiring up the last two hexagons, the rain returned and this time it was coming down enough for us to call it a day. Things are shaping up just in time for Kiez Burn, stay tuned...
